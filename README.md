# Stock-Prediction
This repository uses Generative Models to predict stock prices using time series data from the past. We used HMMs, VAEs and GANs to predict the closing price of the stock in the future, to assist traders make decisions. 

HMM: The HMM uses the hmmlearn python package to learn a Gaussian HMM on stock data. The model can be run using the hmm.py file. By default it plots the predictions for NASDAQ from Jan 2018 to May 2018.
